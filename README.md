# Front End Basics Refiller
As a non-CS major and have been working two years as a front end developer, I find myself lacking the understanding of some basic mechanisms such as how browser works, how JavaScript works, even how computer works, etc. I am therefore taking this chance to try to understand where everything lives and how they work together to produce web pages in a more fundamental level. This repo is used to organize the articles and books I read on this effort.

## How JavaScript Works

Clears the myth how JavaScript and browser APIs (alongside with some other essential APIs) are actually different things.

🗒️[Introduction to Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction)

📹[Philip Roberts: What the heck is the event loop anyway? | JSConf EU 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

This is probably the go-to explanation of event loop.
