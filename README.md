# Front End Basics Refiller
As a non-CS major and have been working (this year - 2016) years as a front end developer, I find myself lacking the understanding of some basic mechanisms such as how browser works, how JavaScript works, even how computer works, etc. I am therefore taking this chance to try to understand where everything lives and how they work together to produce web pages in a more fundamental level. This repo is used to organize the articles and books I read on this effort.

## How JavaScript Works

🗒️[What is JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)

Clears the myth how JavaScript and browser APIs (alongside with some other essential APIs) are actually different things.

This is probably the go-to explanation of event loop.

> This guy's answer is very fluent, shows mastery. I don't want to get his answer directly but it inspired me to know to what extend I should be familiar with this part of the knowledge.

## React

### React-Redux

- [Using the React-Redux Bindings](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/presentations/workshops/redux-fundamentals/react-redux.html)
  Explains what `React-Redux` does, (to save your life from re-implementing the subscriber to Redux store by yourself), note their performance optimizations. Briefly explains its implementation. Very well-written, concise tutorial.

## Becoming a Better Programmer in General

📖[Clean Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code?from_search=true) 

> I was amazed by reading one of my coworker's work. He can always write good code even on top of bad code. He recommended this book that I am currently reading.
